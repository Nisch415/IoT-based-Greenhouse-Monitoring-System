# IoT-based-Greenhouse-Monitoring-System

A smart Greenhouse Monitoring System is implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer using IoT. It consists of the following subsystems-
Sprinkler System, Temperature Monitoring System, Humidity Monitoring System, Smoke Detection System, Carbon Dioxide Monitoring System, Security System, Solar Power System.
 
Different sensors like temperature sensor, Humidity sensor, CO2 detector and so on are used to monitor the environmental conditions. The soil moisture content is monitored in the sprinkler system, the temperature is monitored under temperature system, percentage of humidity in the air is monitored in humidity monitoring system, Smoke and CO2 are also detected inside the greenhouse. A Solar Cell is used to generate energy that can be further converted and used in the system. A smart door system is also implemented here. All the devices used are interconnected and in turn monitored using a Smartphone. The sensors sense the various parameters in environment, based on which the actuators are activated.
